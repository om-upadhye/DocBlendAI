"""Supports Module 2 — turn PDF pages and image files into page images for OCR and HTR.

Responsibility: yield one grayscale PIL image per page:
- PDF: rasterize with pypdfium2 (already a pdfplumber dependency, so no
  Poppler install is needed)
- image files: each image is one page (multi-page TIFF: one page per frame);
  phone photos are turned upright from their EXIF orientation, transparency
  is flattened onto white, and images are scaled to about an A4 page (large
  photos down, small screenshots up to 3x)

Uses from schemas.py: nothing; returns PIL images to ocr_extractor/htr_extractor.
