"""Module 6 — Reliability Tier Classification.

Responsibility: label an answer Certain / Moderate / Uncertain / Unreadable by
jointly weighing retrieval relevance (similarity) and recognition confidence
(calibrated) of the evidence it rests on: the top-ranked retrieval result.

    Unreadable  confidence < UNREADABLE_MAX_CONF (the relevant text could not
                be read reliably, whatever its similarity)
    Certain     similarity >= CERTAIN_MIN_SIM and confidence >= CERTAIN_MIN_CONF
    Moderate    similarity >= MODERATE_MIN_SIM and confidence >= MODERATE_MIN_CONF
    Uncertain   everything else, including no evidence at all

Using two thresholds instead of one on combined_score keeps each label
explainable: "Moderate because the handwriting was only partly legible" vs
"Moderate because the match was loose".

Uses from schemas.py: RetrievalResult, ReliabilityLabel.
